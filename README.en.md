# Startalk EJABBERD

Startalk takes ejabberd as basis, but revised it based on the need of business. Startalk team revised and extended some functions that are not available in ejabberd.

## Key functions

- Distributed: removed the codes that depend on mnesia cluster for supporting bigger cluster, which avoid the inconsistent of condition of cluster due to partition network
- Message handling: through connecting ejabberd and kafka, it achieves message routing and subscription publishing, enabling us to add more ways to handle the messages.

## Modules of Startalk

### Startalk includes:

+ [ejabberd](https://github.com/qunarcorp/ejabberd-open)

the core component of IM. It maintains the connection with client app and message routing

+ [or](https://github.com/qunarcorp/or_open)

the load balancing component of IM. It verifies the identity of client app and forwards the request from http to the corresponding backstage services

+ [im_http_service](https://github.com/qunarcorp/im_http_service_open)

Port service of IM HTTP. It takes charge of searching the data and settings, as well as synchronizing the chat history (a java service based on tomcat).

+ [qfproxy](https://github.com/qunarcorp/qfproxy_open)

IM file service. It takes charge of uploading and downloading the file (a java service based on tomcat).

+ [push_service](https://github.com/qunarcorp/push_service_open)

Push service in IM. It pushes off-line messages (a java service based on tomcat).

+ [qtalk_serach](https://github.com/qunarcorp/qtalk_search)

It provides the service to search people and groups remotely

+ redis

Caching service in IM

+ postgresql

database service in IM

## Announcements

Please read and follow the guide carefully:

* DO NOT use root account for following operations. Many software check the current username, so please create a new user;
* You need to load the configuration before starting redis;
* For startalk, the domain in configuration is important, so please check the configuration carefully;
* Please make sure that the following ports are NOT occupied before start:
```
openresty：8080
im_http_service：8005 8009 8081
qfproxy：8006 8010 8082
push_service：8007 8011 8083
qtalk_search：8888

im： 5202 10050 5280

db: 5432 

redis: 6379
```

## Installation

Prerequisite (If the hostname and username are not same as the name below, you need to change them to your name)

+ Server: centos7.x
+ Hostname: startalk.com
+ Add hosts: 127.0.0.1 startalk.com(sudo vim /etc/hosts)
+ All of the items need to be install in “/startalk”
+ Installation user and user group: startalk:startalk  make sure that startalk users have the permission of sudo
+ Under home directory, there is a folder called “download”, all of the files will be downloaded to this folder
+ The username and password: ejabberd:123456, IP address of the server: 127.0.0.1
+ The password of redis: 123456, IP address of the server: 127.0.0.1
+ SQL of the data base initialization is under the doc directory
+ Make sure that you are able to access the port 5202 and 8080 (turn off the firewall: sudo systemctl stop firewalld.service)
+ The domain name of IM service: qtalk (before installing, please determine this name carefully; after determining the domain name, it will cost a lot of time and money to revise it)
+ TLS certification: The defaulted one is a test certification, which can be use online. Please change the file: /startalk/ejabberd/etc/ejabberd/server.pem
+ If there is a warning of overlapping files, please enter “yes” and press the “enter”
+ In the installation files, the commands start with “#” are ran by root; those start with “$” means ordinary users

### Installing back-end searching service

```
Install python 3 or above, the take 3.6 as a standard
$ cd /startalk/download/qtalk_search
$ sudo yum install https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
$ sudo yum install python36u
Install pip3
$ sudo yum -y install python-pip
Please find the modules in“/startalk/download/qtalk_search/requirements.txt”. You’d better use virtualenv to deploy the environment for modules, or python3.6 will be installed under system python environment, which will lead to conflict with python2.7 in centos; meanwhile, you need to install the pip of python3, and appoint the modules needed by the installation of pip3
$ sudo pip install -U virtualenv （install virtualenv）
$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip
$ virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3.6 ./venv （create venv environment under current directory）
Operating environment
$ source venv/bin/activate
Configure “conf/configure.ini”, please see the file for exact parameters. You don’t need to change them if you don’t have a special need
$ sudo vim ./conf/configure.ini
Install the module that needed by this program (if you didn’t install virtualenv, you need sudo yum install python36u-pip, replacing the defaulted pip by sudo pip3.6)
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
Set “PYTHONPATH”
$ export PYTHONPATH=path/to/project/qtalk_search:$PYTHONPATH
Start at backstage
$ supervisord -c conf/supervisor.conf
$ supervisorctl -c conf/supervisor.conf reload
Make sure that the service has started
$ tail -100f log/access.log 
```

Please run the code below to check common errors: [check.sh](https://github.com/qunarcorp/or_open/blob/master/tools/check.sh)

```
# sed -i 's/ip/your ip/g' ./check.sh
# chmod +x check.sh
# ./check.sh
```
If the system reminds you that the 5202 port cannot be visited from the outside network and you need to open the port or turn off the firewall (which is usually caused by the restriction of firewall or the port is not monitored), please use telnet IP 5202 to check.   

Now, the server-side has been installed. Please download the client-side of Startalk

The configured navigation address of client-side:http://ip:8080/newapi/nck/qtalk_nav.qunar 
Please use the username and password “admin & testpassword” to login (replace IP with the IP of your own server)

Information about how to configure navigation: how to configure navigation on client-side 

Please generate a QR Code at [http://www.liantu.com/](http://www.liantu.com) for the navigation address at (or you can generate QR Code at other websites), then add the navigation on mobile app by scanning the QR Code.

## Branches and PR
